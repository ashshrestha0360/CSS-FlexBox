            <h3>Video-1</h3>
            <p>Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point. When you click Online Video, you can paste in
                the
                embed code for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for the video
                that
                best fits your document.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item-2">
            <h3>Themes-2</h3>
            <p>Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new Theme,
                the
                pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. When you apply styles, your
                headings
                change to match the new theme.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item-3">
            <h3>Reading-3</h3>
            <p>Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and focus on the
                text
                you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off - even
                on
                another device.</p>
